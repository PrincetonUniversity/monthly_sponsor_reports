# Monthly Sponsor Reports

The software in this repo generates monthly sponsor reports for the Research Computing clusters. Below is an example report:

```
Sponsor: Garegin Andrea (gandrea)
 Period: Nov 1, 2021 - Jan 31, 2022

                                   Della

You are receiving this report because you sponsor researchers on the
Research Computing systems. The report above shows the researchers
that you sponsor as well as their cluster usage. Only researchers
that ran at least one job during the reporting period appear in the
table(s) above.

Replying to this email will open a ticket with CSES. Please reply
with questions/comments or to unsubscribe from these reports.
```

The names above were created [randomly](https://www.behindthename.com/random/).

## Usage

Obtain the code:

```bash
$ ssh <YourNetID>@della.princeton.edu
$ git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/monthly_sponsor_reports.git
$ cd monthly_sponsor_reports
```

Run the unit tests:

```bash
$ module load anaconda3/2021.11
$ python -m unittest tests/test_monthly_sponsor_reports.py -v
```

If all of the tests pass then do a dry run (which takes a few minutes):

```bash
$ python monthly_sponsor_reports.py --months=3
```

It is normal to see warnings like the following during the dry run:

```
...
W: Sponsor entry of mbreixo (Mari Breixo) found for jiryna on stellar. Corrected to mbreixo.
W: Sponsor entry of USER found for ec2342 on della. Corrected to ecmorale.
W: Primary sponsor for kb4172 taken from CSV file.
W: User mlakshmi has multiple primary sponsors: gandrea,cbus. Using gandrea.
...
```

The output will be sent to stdout instead of email for the dry run. If the output looks good then run once more with emails enabled:

```bash
$ python monthly_sponsor_reports.py --months=3 --email
```

## Cron

These reports run under cron on tigergpu:

```
[jdh4@tigergpu ~]$ crontab -l
56 8 1 * * /usr/licensed/anaconda3/2021.11/bin/python -u -B /home/jdh4/bin/monthly_sponsor_reports/monthly_sponsor_reports.py --months=3 --email > /home/jdh4/bin/monthly_sponsor_reports/output.log 2>&1
```

## Be Aware

- A sponsor will only receive a report if one of their users ran at least one job in the reporting period.  
- If the sponsor is not found for a given user on a given cluster then that record is omitted. These events can be seen in the output and should be addressed. 
- The script must be executed on a machine that can talk to ldap1.rc.princeton.edu.  
- The script is written to only send emails once on the 1st of the month and then not again for at least 27 days (see `.brakefile` in "sanity checks and safeguards" in Python script).
